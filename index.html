								From early 2017 towards the end of 2019, <a href="https://escapastudio.com/" target="_blank">Escapa Studio</a> was my second home. The recognized music house with Chilean roots helped me develop my skills and career in the sound post production business. Starting as an intern, all the way to earning my place taking care of Studio B. There, I was able to deliver campaigns for Adidas, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Multicenter, Tigo, JAC and several other local and international brands.
							</p>

							<p>
								During a brief stay in Denmark, I met Katarzyna Romatowska, a talented Polish director and writer with whom I had the pleasure to work with in the short film <a href="https://youtu.be/vTY-1zN08uM" target="_blank">Polaczone</a>. This copy is being shared for reel purposes only, please do not distribute.

								<a href="https://www.mauromatone.com/safest-radiotherapy" target="_blank">Radiotherapy</a> was an award-winning piece we were happy to be a part of. Helping spread the word about the importance of detecting breast cancer in time.
							</p>

							<p>
								<a href="https://www.mauromatone.com/banca-activa" target="_blank">Banca Activa</a>, winner of the Forbes Ad of the Year in 2019 was a beautifully crafted campaign for the Bolivian National Bank. And the sound design had to keep up with the incredible work the team put up.
							</p>

							<p>
								The <a href="https://youtu.be/tNt4RZp3ULo" target="_blank">Adidas Marathon</a> took place in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, giving us the opportunity to work on a commercial shot between the darkness and the soft light of dawn.  
							</p>

							<p>
								With 'Even the heaviest of loads' JAC brought <a href="https://youtu.be/6ilgrEtiNfg" target="_blank">a new truck</a>. Having shot several pieces for this campaign, this one brought out a few special traits that I deem worth sharing.

								Although guitar and piano are the only instruments that I paid to learn, I never really played them. In 2015, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0YOLH9TIP7O6oDFPz9JXju" target="_blank">Torkuatos</a> needed a new bassist and I filled in for a few years. During my time with them we were able to record an EP, a 9-song LP and finish songs that would later fill a second EP and take part of a future LP.

								A sudden return due to unforeseen circumstances caused me to be (almost) stuck in airports. The messages warning about the coronavirus in each airport inspired <a href="https://youtu.be/Y7LMxK6QWIo" target="_blank">this piece of work</a>.

								On the 25th of May, 1809 in the city of Chuquisaca, Bolivia (now Sucre) a movement began, rumours spread and people weren't happy. 
							</p>

							<p>
								The decision was made to gather the town around the main cathedral in the Templo de San Francisco to make a decision. The bell was rung long and hard until everyone could hear it and come around. And it rang until it cracked. The event that took place afterwards is remembered as the 'First Libertarian Scream'.

								Along with Matone, we worked on <a href="https://www.mauromatone.com/drops-and-sparks-tigre" target="_blank">'Drops and Sparks'</a>. An award-winning piece, where I was given the opportunity to voiceover as well.

								Flickering lights is an ongoing activity initiated sometime in late-2018. The idea being to capture lights going through imperfections, short-circuits or any other sort of malfunction that makes them interact in a non-intentional way. Please do not watch if you are prompt to seizures, photosensitive or suffer from any conditions that may make you malfunction while watching this.

								Throughout the pandemic, Covid-19 insurance began to roll out. But getting it first doesn't mean absolute safety. Maintaining protection is just as important as knowing that if something happens, you'll be safe and sound.
							</p>

							<p>
								Stay away from homemade solutions and protect yourself. For real.
